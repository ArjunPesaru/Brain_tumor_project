# Introduction
This project focuses on brain tumor segmentation using a 2D U-Net architecture tailored for multi-class segmentation of brain tumors. Leveraging MRI data from the BraTS2020 dataset, the model identifies and delineates key tumor regions, including necrosis, edema, and enhancing tumor areas. This work emphasizes computational efficiency, segmentation accuracy, and robust preprocessing techniques.

# Features
- **Architecture**: U-Net with skip connections for precise tumor boundary delineation.
- **Multi-Modality Input**: T1ce (contrast-enhanced) and FLAIR MRI modalities for enhanced segmentation accuracy.
- **Custom Data Generator**: Efficient real-time loading and preprocessing of MRI slices.
- **Hybrid Loss Function**: Combines categorical cross-entropy and Dice loss to address class imbalance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Dice Coefficient, IoU, Precision, Sensitivity, and Specificity for performance evaluation.

# Dataset
The project uses the **BraTS2020 dataset**, which provides expert-annotated MRI scans labeled into four segmentation classes:
- **Class 0**: Background (Non-Tumor Region)
- **Class 1**: Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor
- **Class 2**: Peritumoral Edema
- **Class 3**: Enhancing Tumor

## Key Characteristics
- MRI scans are 3D volumes with dimensions of 240×240×155.
- The dataset includes four MRI modalities: T1, T1ce, T2, and FLAIR.
- Significant class imbalance and memory constraints necessitated preprocessing optimizations.

# Methodology
## Preprocessing Pipeline
- **Slice Selection**: Retains only slices 60–135 to focus on tumor-relevant regions.
- **Normalization**: Ensures uniformity by applying zero mean and unit variance scaling.
- **Resizing**: Reduces slice dimensions to 128×128 for computational efficiency.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Transforms segmentation masks for multi-class predictions.

## Model Architecture
- **Encoder**: Extracts hierarchical features using convolutional layers and max-pooling.
- **Bottleneck**: Employs dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Decoder**: Uses transposed convolutions and skip connections to enhance spatial resolution.
- **Output Layer**: Produces multi-class segmentation probabilities using softmax activation.
